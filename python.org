#+TITLE: My Python notes

I tend to learn by example but also forget language syntax and semantics if I don't program using in that language for some time. So
I've made it a habit to capture notes (mostly concepts and examples). These notes are based on: https://bugs.python.org/file47781/Tutorial_EDIT.pdf.

* Concepts

** Python memory model
