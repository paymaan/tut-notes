# Go Programming Language Notes

Golang's website has one of the best resource list found [here](https://golang.org/doc/). From this link, beginners can find most information they need. Particularly, I've used [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) to compile these notes.

We'll cover:

1. Packages, variables, and functions
2. Flow control (if/else, etc.)
3. Structs, slices, and maps
4. Methods, and interfaces
5. Concurrency
