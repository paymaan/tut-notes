* Source code
** <s TAB directly inserts code blocks
** language buffer using C-c ' when inside the block
** C-c-c to evaluate code block
** can install packages for code syntax highlighting in emacs and when exported

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
  def fact(n)
    if n == 0
      1
    else
      n * fact(n-1)
    end
  end
#+END_SRC
   
* LaTeX integration
- Characters: \alpha \rightarrow \beta
- $O(n \log n)$

\begin{align*}
3 * 2 * 1 &= 6 + 1 \\
          &= 7
\end{align*}

- The LaTeX snippet above will use MathJax (comes with org) to export
  
* Literate programming

* Todo stuff!
** TODO upload this to github
** TODO can add deadlines using C-c C-d or C-c-d
   DEADLINE: <2017-02-28 Tue>
** Can quickly modify time stamps using shift + arrow keys
** DONE cycle through states using C-c C-t (or C-c-t)
** Can add extra cycles like WAITING etc.
** Can use "org-agenda" to get a holistic view and manage todos
