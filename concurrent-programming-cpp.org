* Introduction

** Concurrent programming models
1) Multi-processing
   - 1 thread / process
   - Threads communicate through /Interprocess communication/ channels e.g. files, types, message queues.
2) Multi-threading
   - >= 2 threads / process
   - Threads communicate through /shared memory/.
   - Pros
     * Thread faster to start (considered /light-weight process/).
     * Thread has low overhead (process needs extra protection to avoid over-stepping).
     * Communicating through shared memory faster than interprocess communication.
     * Overall, multi-threading provides better performance than multi-processing.
   - Cons
     * Difficult to implement (have to deal with thread specific issues).
     * Can't run on distributed systems; multi-processing on the other hand can be easily distributed on such systems and therefore, run concurrently.
       * Main reason for this is that shared memory blocks concurrent distribution
